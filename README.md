xunit-converter
===============

Library to convert test reports to XUnit format

##Supported Formats:

* Nose
* JSUnit
* MsTest

##Project Contribution
I'm purposefully trying to be as basic as possible here since I had a lot of trouble setting up and developing in this project, not because there was anything wrong with the project itself but because I am so new to java development.

###Prerequisites
* JavaIDE - I'm using IntellJ IDEA (14.1.2)
* JavaJDK version 1.7 +
* JAVA_HOME environment variable correctly setup
* Maven - I'm using [Maven 3.3.3](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

```
cd xunit-converter
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
